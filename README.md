# Top Courses

Welcome to my second React mini-project! This application showcases a curated list of top courses, incorporating various React features and tools.

## Features

- **State Management**: Utilizes the `useState` hook for dynamic state handling. 💡
- **Side Effects**: Implements the `useEffect` hook to manage component lifecycle events. ☑️
- **Iconography**: Integrates `react-icons` for enhanced visual appeal.❄️
- **Notifications**: Employs `react-toastify` for user-friendly toast notifications.🔔
- **Data Handling**: Leverages JavaScript's `map` function for efficient data rendering.📊
- **API Integration**: Performs API calls to fetch and display real-time course data.🅰️
